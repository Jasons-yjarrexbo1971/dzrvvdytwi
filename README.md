OMG, just finished 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 iHostage... dude, what a trip. Like, the whole thing, start to finish, just mind-blowing. First of all, that plot twist? Didn’t see it coming. Or maybe I did, but I’m too tired to know right now, lol. It’s like they took every thriller trope and decided to mix it up, you know what I mean? At one point I was literally yelling at the screen like, How can you NOT see that coming? 😂

So there’s this one scene where they just flip everything upside down, and I legit had to pause and take a breather. You gotta 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   and see what I mean. The characters, bro, some of them drive me insane. Like, how do you make SO many bad decisions in one  ? But I guess that’s why we love it, can't expect much else, right?

> Anyway, the ending though. Like, are they seriously setting us up for a sequel? 😂 I swear if there’s a part two, I might have to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it just to see what kinda nonsense they come up with next. Also, the music? Banging. Perfect vibes for all the chaos happening. 

Oh, and the whole time I’m just sitting there thinking, WHY am I so invested in these fictional peeps? Honestly, when you 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  , you gotta be ready for some serious WTF moments. Also, the action sequences? Ridiculously over-the-top, but somehow it works. 

for x in range(10): print(why am I doing this?)

Anyway man, that’s my 2am brain dump. I should sleep soon. But bro, seriously, 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it when you get the chance. Let me know if you love it or hate it or both. 💤😆
